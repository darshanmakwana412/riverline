Riverline Evals Take-Home Assignment
=====================================

Implement the AgentEvaluator class below.

Run your evaluator locally:
    python eval_takehome.py

See README.md for full instructions and spec.pdf for the formal specification.

class AgentEvaluator:

    Evaluate WhatsApp debt collection conversations against the agent specification.

    Your evaluator should assess:
    - Spec compliance (does the conversation follow the state machine?)
    - Risk (how likely is this conversation to cause a complaint?)
    - Specific violations (which spec rules were broken, and where?)

    You may use any tools, models, or libraries you want.
